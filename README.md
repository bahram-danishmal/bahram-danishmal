# Hey, I’m Bahram 👋

I love machine learning, cybersecurity, and figuring out how things work (and sometimes, how to break them, ethically, of course). I'm also always on the hunt for new frameworks and tools to mess around with.
I’m a Year 12 student currently working on my Computer Science NEA, alongside studying Maths and Physics
